# Expense-Manager-System

Got it 👍 You’re sketching out a **menu-driven Expense Management System** (like a CLI program) with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Your structure is correct, but let’s refine and flesh out the full project so it can actually be implemented.

Here’s a complete design:

---

## 📌 Expense Manager Menu Flow

```
Start
   |
Show Menu
   |
Choose Option
   |
   ├── (1) Create Expense
   │       └── Input: date, category, description, amount
   │
   ├── (2) Read Expense
   │       ├── (a) Read All
   │       ├── (b) Filter (e.g., by date, category, amount range)
   │       ├── (c) Read by Order (sort by date, amount, category…)
   │       └── (d) Read as Chart (bar/pie chart for categories, monthly totals…)
   │
   ├── (3) Select Expense (choose by ID or index)
   │
   ├── (4) Update Expense
   │       └── Update fields (category, description, amount…)
   │
   ├── (5) Delete Expense
   │       └── Delete by ID or index
   │
   └── (6) Exit
```

## 📌 Suggested Data Structure

We can store each expense as a **dictionary** in Python:

```python
expense = {
    "id": 1,
    "date": "2025-08-22",
    "category": "Food",
    "description": "Lunch",
    "amount": 12.50
}
```

And maintain all expenses in a **list**:

```python
expenses = []
```

Later you can extend it to **SQLite / JSON / CSV** for persistence.

## 📌 Example Python CLI Implementation

Would you like me to:

1. ✅ Make a **basic CLI version** (only text, no storage, just runs while program is open).
2. ✅ Make a **persistent version** (saves expenses to a file like JSON/CSV so data stays after program exits).
3. ✅ Make a **persistent + charts version** (using `matplotlib` to visualize expenses by category/month).

👉 Which one do you want me to complete first?
